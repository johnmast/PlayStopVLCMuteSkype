## Synopsis

This is i simple script that when you play a multimedia file in vlc, skype puts the current call on mute. Only 15 lines of code!

## Motivation

Many times with my friends we leave skype open and we do our work, but I need to play a movie file or listen to a song without interruption. So I made this AppleScript that automatically understands when you play/pause a multimedia file in VLC and toggle's mute on/of the current call.

## Installation

Just run the Application file in you mac

Thank you!
